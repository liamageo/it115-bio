Hello everyone, my name is Liaina (Lia) Mageo.
I am currently in the process of emerging as a professional, thanks to a program called "Year Up".
Former superiors and co-workers can attest to my exceptional leadership skills, strong work ethic, and 
welcoming persona.
After having worked many hard labor jobs in the past, I am currently working toward pursuing a career 
as a Quality Assurance Tester. 
My late Grandfather worked in the IT department for Microsoft, which had inspired me to pursue the tech 
field. 
I plan to successfully complete my courses and enter an internship where I can gain hands-on experience,
receive direction from experienced QA professionals and prepare myself for a career in Quality Assurance.
I look forward to working with you all, and receiving insight and feedback that will assist me in furthering
my career.
