Hello everyone, my name is Liana (Lia) Mageo.
I am currently in the process of emerging as a professional, thanks to a program called "Year Up".
Former superiors and co-workers can attest to my exceptional leadership skills, strong work ethic and welcoming persona.
After having worked many hard labor jobs in the past, I am currently working towards pursuing a career as a Quality Assurance Tester. 
My late Grandfather worked in the IT department for Microsoft, which had inspired me to pursue the tech field.
